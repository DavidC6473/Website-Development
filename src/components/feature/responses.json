        "I have a diverse set of skills in web development. I completed a Master's in Interactive Media at University College Cork (UCC) with First Class Honours. During my studies, I created VR Jam, my thesis project, which involved using TypeScript, Three.js, Tone.js on the frontend, and Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO on the backend. VR Jam allowed users to interact over the web in virtual reality and play real-time music together. It was an exciting project that demonstrated my proficiency in these technologies.\n\nSince then, I have been continuously self-learning and improving my skills. I have gained expertise in Python, JavaScript, React, and Django. Additionally, I have worked on various projects involving APIs and even delved into machine learning.\n\nFeel free to ask me more about any specific skill!"
